        The words nature and natural are used for all the things that are
        normally not made by humans.<br />The word comes from the Latin natura
        meaning "birth". <br />Nature includes many things like weather,
        organisms, landforms, celestial bodies.<br />
        Scientists study the way the parts of nature work.<br />
        Things that have been made by people are said to be man-made or called
        artifacts.

        <br />
        <p class="Poem">
          That time of year thou mayst in me behold <br />
          When yellow leaves, or none, or few, do hang <br />
          Upon those boughs which shake against the cold, <br />
          Bare ruin'd choirs, where late the sweet birds sang. <br />
          In me thou see'st the twilight of such day <br />
          As after sunset fadeth in the west, Which by and by black night doth
          take away,<br />
          Death's second self, that seals up all in rest. <br />
          In me thou see'st the glowing of such fire That on the ashes of his
          youth doth lie,<br />
          As the death-bed whereon it must expire, <br />
          Consum'd with that which it was nourish'd by. <br />
          This thou perceiv'st, which makes thy love more strong, <br />
          To love that well which thou must leave ere long.
        </p>
