      <h1>A little more about Plants!</h1>
      <p>
        Plants are the eukaryotes that form the kingdom Plantae; they are
        predominantly photosynthetic. <br />
        This means that they obtain their energy from sunlight, using
        chloroplasts derived from endosymbiosis with cyanobacteria to produce
        sugars from carbon dioxide and water, using the green pigment
        chlorophyll. <br />
        Exceptions are parasitic plants that have lost the genes for chlorophyll
        and photosynthesis, and obtain their energy from other plants or fungi.
        Most plants are multicellular, except for some green algae. <br />
        Historically, as in Aristotle's biology, the plant kingdom encompassed
        all living things that were not animals, and included algae and fungi.
        Definitions have narrowed since then; current definitions exclude the
        fungi and some of the algae. <br />
        By the definition used in this article, plants form the clade
        Viridiplantae (green plants), which consists of the green algae and the
        embryophytes or land plants (hornworts, liverworts, mosses, lycophytes,
        ferns, conifers and other gymnosperms, and flowering plants). <br />
        A definition based on genomes includes the Viridiplantae, along with the
        red algae and the glaucophytes, in the clade Archaeplastida. There are
        about 380,000 known species of plants, of which the majority, some
        260,000, produce seeds. They range in size from single cells to the
        tallest trees. <br />
        Green plants provide a substantial proportion of the world's molecular
        oxygen; the sugars they create supply the energy for most of Earth's
        ecosystems and other organisms, including animals, either eat plants
        directly or rely on organisms which do so. <br />
        Grain, fruit, and vegetables are basic human foods and have been
        domesticated for millennia. People use plants for many purposes, such as
        building materials, ornaments, writing materials, and, in great variety,
        for medicines. <br />The scientific study of plants is known as botany,
        a branch of biology.
