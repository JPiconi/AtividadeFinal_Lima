      <p class="P">
        Nature is an inherent character or constitution,particularly of the
        ecosphere or the universe as a whole. <br />
        In this general sense nature refers to the laws, elements and phenomena
        of the physical world, including life. <br />
        Although humans are part of nature, human activity or humans as a whole
        are often described as at times at odds, or outright separate and even
        superior to nature. <br />During the advent of modern scientific method
        in the last several centuries, nature became the passive reality,
        organized and moved by divine laws. <br />
        With the Industrial Revolution, nature increasingly became seen as the
        part of reality deprived from intentional intervention: it was hence
        considered as sacred by some traditions (Rousseau, American
        transcendentalism) or a mere decorum for divine providence or human
        history (Hegel, Marx). <br />
        However, a vitalist vision of nature, closer to the pre-Socratic one,
        got reborn at the same time, especially after Charles Darwin. Within the
        various uses of the word today, "nature" often refers to geology and
        wildlife. <br />
        Nature can refer to the general realm of living beings, and in some
        cases to the processes associated with inanimate objects—the way that
        particular types of things exist and change of their own accord, such as
        the weather and geology of the Earth. <br />
        It is often taken to mean the "natural environment" or wilderness—wild
        animals, rocks, forest, and in general those things that have not been
        substantially altered by human intervention, or which persist despite
        human intervention. <br />
        For example, manufactured objects and human interaction generally are
        not considered part of nature, unless qualified as, for example, "human
        nature" or "the whole of nature". <br />
        This more traditional concept of natural things that can still be found
        today implies a distinction between the natural and the artificial, with
        the artificial being understood as that which has been brought into
        being by a human consciousness or a human mind. <br />
        Depending on the particular context, the term "natural" might also be
        distinguished from the unnatural or the supernatural.
