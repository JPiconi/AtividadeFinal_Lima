      <h1>A little more about Animals!</h1>
      <p>
        Animals are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms in the biological
        kingdom Animalia. With few exceptions, animals consume organic material,
        breathe oxygen, have myocytes and are able to move, can reproduce
        sexually, and grow from a hollow sphere of cells, the blastula, during
        embryonic development. Animals form a clade, meaning that they arose
        from a single common ancestor. <br />
        Over 1.5 million living animal species have been described, of which
        around 1.05 million are insects, over 85,000 are molluscs, and around
        65,000 are vertebrates. It has been estimated there are as many as 7.77
        million animal species on Earth. Animal body lengths range from 8.5 Î¼m
        (0.00033 in) to 33.6 m (110 ft). <br />
        They have complex ecologies and interactions with each other and their
        environments, forming intricate food webs. The scientific study of
        animals is known as zoology, and the study of animal behaviour is known
        as ethology. The animal kingdom is divided into five
        infrakingdoms/superphyla, namely Porifera, Ctenophora, Placozoa,
        Cnidaria and Bilateria. <br />
        Most living animal species belong to the infrakingdom Bilateria, a
        highly proliferative clade whose members have a bilaterally symmetric
        and significantly cephalised body plan, and the vast majority of
        bilaterians belong to two large superphyla: the protostomes, which
        includes organisms such as arthropods, molluscs, flatworms, annelids and
        nematodes; and the deuterostomes, which include echinoderms,
        hemichordates and chordates, the latter of which contains the
        vertebrates. <br />
        The much smaller basal phylum Xenacoelomorpha have an uncertain position
        within Bilateria. Animals first appear in the fossil record in the late
        Cryogenian period and diversified in the subsequent Ediacaran period in
        what is known as the Avalon explosion. Earlier evidence of animals is
        still controversial; the sponge-like organism Otavia has been dated back
        to the Tonian period at the start of the Neoproterozoic, but its
        identity as an animal is heavily contested. <br />
        Nearly all modern animal phyla became clearly established in the fossil
        record as marine species during the Cambrian explosion, which began
        around 539 million years ago (Mya), and most classes during the
        Ordovician radiation 485.4 Mya. 6,331 groups of genes common to all
        living animals have been identified; these may have arisen from a single
        common ancestor that lived about 650 Mya during the Cryogenian period.
        <br />
        Historically, Aristotle divided animals into those with blood and those
        without. Carl Linnaeus created the first hierarchical biological
        classification for animals in 1758 with his Systema Naturae, which
        Jean-Baptiste Lamarck expanded into 14 phyla by 1809. In 1874, Ernst
        Haeckel divided the animal kingdom into the multicellular Metazoa (now
        synonymous with Animalia) and the Protozoa, single-celled organisms no
        longer considered animals. <br />
        In modern times, the biological classification of animals relies on
        advanced techniques, such as molecular phylogenetics, which are
        effective at demonstrating the evolutionary relationships between taxa.
        Humans make use of many other animal species for food (including meat,
        eggs, and dairy products), for materials (such as leather, fur, and
        wool), as pets and as working animals for transportation, and services.
        <br />
        Dogs, the first domesticated animal, have been used in hunting, in
        security and in warfare, as have horses, pigeons and birds of prey;
        while other terrestrial and aquatic animals are hunted for sports,
        trophies or profits. Non-human animals are also an important cultural
        element of human evolution, having appeared in cave arts and totems
        since the earliest times, and are frequently featured in mythology,
        religion, arts, literature, heraldry, politics, and sports.
